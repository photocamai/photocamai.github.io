      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        At <strong>Photo CamAI</strong>, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users.
        This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how it is used, and the steps we take to protect your information.
        We are committed to transparency and data protection in every aspect of our app.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Image Data</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect, store, or share any image data in any way. The Photo CamAI app
        allows users to edit and process photos directly from their devices.
        During this process, no image or facial data is extracted, uploaded, or stored.
        As a result, there is no collection or retention of face data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Photo CamAI never transmits image data to servers or external systems.
        All image-related actions occur solely on the user’s device.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Edit With AI Feature</h2>
      <p>
        The Edit With AI feature allows users to enhance and transform their photos using artificial intelligence. 
        All AI processing is performed locally on the user’s device. No photos, image data, or facial information are uploaded, stored, or shared externally. Images remain entirely on the user’s device and are never accessed by our team or any server. This feature follows the same strict privacy measures as all other features of Photo CamAI.

      <h2>Identifiers</h2>
      <p>
        Photo CamAI may collect certain device identifiers, such as a “device ID,” to
        distinguish between devices. These identifiers are not linked to individual user identities
        and are used solely for service functionality. User identity data is never collected or shared.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Usage Data</h2>
      <p>
        We collect anonymized usage data to understand user interactions, detect errors,
        and improve performance. This data does not include personal information
        and is analyzed only in aggregate form.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help improve the app, we use <strong>App Store Connect</strong>, <strong>Google Analytics</strong>,
        and <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, which provide anonymized and generic app usage or transaction data.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Advertising and Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Photo CamAI does not include advertisements and has no advertising partners.
        Therefore, no cookies, web beacons, or third-party ad servers are used within the app.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Photo CamAI is intended for a general audience and is not directed toward children under 13 years of age.
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
        If we become aware of any such collection, we will delete the data as required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be reflected on this page,
        and a notice will be displayed within the app before changes take effect.
        The “Last updated” date at the top will always indicate the latest revision.
